# pyabc2

[![CI workflow status](https://github.com/zmoon/PyABC2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zmoon/PyABC2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Inspired in part by and potentially using some portions of [PyABC](https://github.com/campagnola/pyabc) (`pyabc`), hence the package name `pyabc2`.
